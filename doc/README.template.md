# JSON Schema Compiled ChecK

Fast validation against JSON Schema Draft 3

## Installation

```
$ npm install jsck
```


## About


JSCK is a "compiling" schema validator, meaning that it traverses a schema only once (at instantiation)
and generates the functions needed to validate documents against the schema.
By doing so, it avoids the need to re-traverse the schema structure for every document it validates.
This leads to substantial performance improvements.

For the initial (0.1.x) release, JSCK will only tell you whether a document passes validation, not where it failed or why.

Supports most of JSON Schema Draft 3. [Documentation][draft3_doc] and [implementation][draft3_impl].


## Usage


```../examples/draft3_basic.coffee```


### [Advanced usage examples](examples/draft3_advanced.coffee)



## Coverage

Currently passing the canonical [test suite][canonical] for draft3 except for these items:

* `refRemote` (Trying to keep this lib synchronous for v0.1.x)
* `ref`
  * remote ref, containing refs itself
* `uniqueItems`
* `optional/zeroTerminatedFloats`
* `optional/format` (some of the regexes borrowed from [tdegrunt's validator](https://github.com/tdegrunt/jsonschema) aren't working for me)

To run all tests: `coffee test`.

To run only the test suite named "disallow", use:

    coffee test/draft3_test.coffee disallow

And to run only the third test of that suite, use:

    coffee test/draft3_test.coffee disallow 3

You'll find the "disallow" test suite in the source tree. (Don't forget to initialize the git submodules! That test suite is in a git submodule.)

### Managing resolution scope with the "id" attribute


JSCK does not support the full range of scope manipulations suggested by drafts 3 and 4.  It uses "id" declarations only in these cases:

* at the top level of a schema, to provide a namespace for schemas not loaded from URIs.
* non-JSON-pointer fragments (`"id": "#user"`), which serve merely as aliases for specific subschemas, and are thus convenient and unambiguous.

For more information on the topic of scope manipulation, see this issue: https://github.com/json-schema/json-schema/issues/77.


## Benchmarks

Results of a simple (probably flawed) [benchmark against other libs](./benchmarks/event.coffee). 8 iterations.  Units are ms.

```

JSCK: valid document, 400 times { max: 2.596,
  median: 0.494,
  min: 0.491,
  mean: 0.76,
  stdDev: 0.6940034221817643,
  sample_size: 8 }

jsonschema: valid document, 400 times { max: 224.818,
  median: 194.503,
  min: 183.965,
  mean: 198.83875,
  stdDev: 14.102769335754596,
  sample_size: 8 }

JSV: valid document, 400 times { max: 5778.058,
  median: 5707.239,
  min: 5664.46,
  mean: 5713.368375,
  stdDev: 38.30406714024464,
  sample_size: 8 }

```

I find it difficult to believe JSV is actually that slow, so it's probably my fault. Possibly incorrect usage of JSV.


## Plans

### 0.1.0

* Boolean validation.
* Correct coverage of most of Draft 3
* benchmarking schemas of varying levels of complexity

### 0.2.0

* validation error reports
* complete support for "format"
* adding more comprehensive tests to the official test suite
* support remote references

### 0.3

* Support Draft 4
